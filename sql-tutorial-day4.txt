#4. SQL WHERE Clause with Operators

    The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
    
   Syntax:
   
    SELECT * FROM table_name
    WHERE Column = value;   
   
   Examples:

 > SQL Arithmetic Operators:

      Example:           
	
      select 8 + 2
      select 9 - 4
      select 3 * 2
      select 8 / 2
      select 8 % 3
	  
	  
-SQL Comparison Operators:

   a)   
    SELECT * FROM users
    WHERE Country='India';     
    
   b)  
    SELECT * FROM Products
    WHERE Price = 18; 
     
   c)    
    SELECT * FROM Products
    WHERE Price > 30;
    
   d)   
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price < 30;
    
   e)   
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price >= 30;
    
   f)   
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price <= 30; 
        
   g)   
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price <> 18;
    
-Logical Operator Examples:
 
   a)
   SELECT ProductName 
   FROM Products
   WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

   b)
   SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE City = "London" AND Country = "UK";
   
   c)
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price > ANY (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Price > 50);
   
   d)
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price BETWEEN 50 AND 60;
   
   e)
   SELECT SupplierName
   FROM Suppliers
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);  
    
   f)
   SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');  
   
   g)
   SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE City LIKE 's%';

   h)
   SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE City NOT LIKE 's%';

   i)
   SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE City = "London" OR Country = "UK";

   j)
   SELECT * FROM Products
   WHERE Price > SOME (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Price > 20); 
 
 
 
 > The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:
 
       
 > SQL Arithmetic Operators:

	Operator	Description	       Example:            Result:
	
	+	        Add	               select 8 + 2        10
	-		Subtract	       select 9 - 4        5 
	*		Multiply	       select 3 * 2        6
	/		Divide	               select 8 / 2        4
	%		Modulo                 select 8 % 3        2  (Remaider)
	        
 > SQL Bitwise Operators:

	Operator	Description
	
	&		Bitwise AND
	|		Bitwise OR
	^		Bitwise exclusive OR
		
 > SQL Comparison Operators:

	Operator	Description
		
	=		Equal to	
	>		Greater than	
	<		Less than	
	>=		Greater than or equal to	
	<=		Less than or equal to	
	<>		Not equal to
	
 > SQL Compound Operators:

	Operator	Description
	
	+=		Add equals
	-=		Subtract equals
	*=		Multiply equals
	/=		Divide equals
	%=		Modulo equals
	&=		Bitwise AND equals
	^-=		Bitwise exclusive equals
	|*=		Bitwise OR equals	
	
 > SQL Logical Operators:

	Operator	Description
		
	ALL		TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition
	AND		TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE	
	ANY		TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition	
	BETWEEN	        TRUE if the operand is within the range of comparisons
	EXI
        STS		TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records	
	IN		TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions	
	LIKE		TRUE if the operand matches a pattern
	NOT		Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE	
	OR		TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE	
	SOME		TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition
