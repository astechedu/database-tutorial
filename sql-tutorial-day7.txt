#7. SQL ORDER BY Keyword

    The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.    
    
    
   Syntax:

	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;    	    
    
    Example:
    
	SELECT * FROM employees;
	ORDER BY emp_fname asc;  
		
	SELECT emp_id, emp_fname FROM employees;
	ORDER BY emp_fname desc; 
	
	SELECT emp_id, emp_fname, emp_city FROM employees;
	ORDER BY emp_city desc; 	 	
	
	SELECT emp_fname, emp_salary, emp_city FROM employees;
	ORDER BY emp_salary asc; 		

	SELECT emp_fname, emp_salary, emp_address, emp_age FROM employees;
	ORDER BY emp_fname desc; 
			
	SELECT * FROM Products
	ORDER BY Price;  
	
	SELECT * FROM Products
	ORDER BY Price;  	        	
	
  	SELECT * FROM employees;
	WHERE emp_id > 5 ORDER BY emp_fname asc;      
	
  	SELECT emp_id, emp_fname, emp_salary FROM employees;
	WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 3 AND 8 ORDER BY emp_fname asc;
	
  	SELECT emp_fname, emp_salary FROM employees;
	WHERE emp_id > 6 ORDER BY emp_salary asc;
	
  	SELECT emp_fname, emp_salary FROM employees;
	WHERE emp_salary > 23000 ORDER BY emp_fname asc;
		
  	SELECT emp_fname, emp_salary FROM employees;
	WHERE emp_salary > 23000 ORDER BY emp_fname desc;	
	
  	SELECT emp_fname, emp_salary FROM employees;
	WHERE emp_country LIKE 'i%' ORDER BY emp_fname asc;
